# EchoSpace ðŸŒŒ

This is aÂ  mental health-focused social platform that encourages authenticity, emotional support, and purposeful anonymity.

EchoSpace is a full-stack web application built with **React**, **Flask**, and **SQLAlchemy**. It allows users to express their thoughts anonymously or with their identity, react to posts, comment, and track moods. This project aims to foster a supportive, non-judgmental online space.
